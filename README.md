# arma-2-Sea_Level

ArmA 2 adjusts sea levels (under water elevations) in 4WVR WRP files.

Unlike Edge Height tool, this adjusts ocean / sea terrain level heights up or down depending what value do you input. You can make deep oceans shallower, or other way around. If ocean level would rise above sea level 0m, its truncated to 0m.
